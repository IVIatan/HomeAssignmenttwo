          <h2>Personal Background</h2>
          <p>
            I grew up in Nof Hagalil and currently live in the student dorms at Ruppin Academic Center.  
            I've always been drawn to new challenges and opportunities to grow — whether it's through studies, personal experiences, or the people I meet along the way.  
            Living independently taught me a lot about myself and pushed me to take responsibility, stay curious, and keep evolving.

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>
            I'm currently studying Business Management and Information Systems at Ruppin Academic Center.  
            This academic track has allowed me to build strong analytical and organizational skills while gaining hands-on experience with digital systems and technologies.  
            It has deepened my understanding of how data, processes, and strategy come together to create effective business solutions.

          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and practicing karate — I've earned a black belt after years of dedication.  
            I'm passionate about animals and spend time volunteering at shelters. My dog Joy has been with me for over 12 years and is a big part of my life.  
            Lately, I've been dreaming of learning how to surf — something about the ocean really draws me in.

          <h2>Personal Values</h2>
          <p>
            I value authenticity, curiosity, and kindness.  
            I believe in approaching challenges with commitment, learning from setbacks, and supporting the people around me.  
            For me, personal and professional growth come from staying true to myself while always being open to new perspectives.
